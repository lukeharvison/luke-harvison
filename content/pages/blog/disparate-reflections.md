The goal of this piece is to hopefully connect some dots that originate in domains that might seem disparate.

Starting with: autism.

They say write what you know. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s in early adolescence, and like many others, I presented my symptoms primarily through social dysfunction. 

Afflicted by blatant social paralysis, I grew up incapable of having normal conversations. I had significant trouble developing friendships, particularly after 5th grade. I had some difficulty with eye contact, and I was hounded by significant anger issues. 

As a child, my anger was insatiable. I threw enormous tantrums. I remember being in kindergarten or 1st grade and sitting in the car one afternoon, reflecting to myself that I hadn’t completely blown a fuse yet that day. Wow, I actually controlled my anger for multiple hours. The outbursts of anger, uncontrollable even after whippings that left wooden spoons in two, plagued me and those around me. I was deeply ashamed of having anger issues. My parents thought I was a danger to myself and those around me. This, undoubtedly, was the greatest affliction of my early adolescence, and  - as one could imagine after shattering your sister’s tea set from South China, being sent to the elementary school principal for beating up a kid named Pierce with his own LEGO blocks, and throwing a stroller which may have had a baby in it (among many other incidents) - it isolated me from peers and adults alike.

As I grew a little older, though, my lack of social skills - not the anger, which tempered over time - became the factor that distanced me the most from those around me. I was a really weird kid. I was extremely quiet, not because I was shy, but because I did not know what to say. To anyone, especially not peers, and sometimes not family. I seemed to lack an imitation gene of sorts, which was present in others and allowed them to absorb the social script, whereas I was left never knowing the screenplay's next line (despite often searching deep into the recesses of my mind). I was fixed behind a glass wall. I could see others organically interacting, electrified by emotional interconnectedness, sustained by deep friendships. I could see it all, but the glass wall blocked me from joining in.

It took me a while - around 14 years - to conceptualize the glass wall, however. In middle school (and prior), I was blissfully ignorant of my weirdness. I did not understand, nor did I care to conceptualize, the need for friends. I was in my happy place when I was alone in a room upstairs reading a book on Nikola Tesla. I was obsessed with Nikola Tesla. Subconsciously I might have been trying to make sense of my own intuitively felt weirdness by inviting myself into the life of a genius eccentric. I lived life within a closed system of sorts, as if I operated on a lesser plane of consciousness. I had no emotional contemplation of acceptance, desire, or status. Like a robot, I just acted. But when I entered high school, this strange state of beingness, living as though I was a singular entity in the universe, ended.

I was only able to conceptualize the glass wall whenever it was shattering. Oh boy, the shattering left me naked on stage. I started being able to feel peoples’ perceptions. Peers were suddenly alive, and their eyes were on me. I hated that feeling and decided that I wanted to fit in. There was one problem with that, though. The script had not been given to me yet. Unable to imitate those around me, I still remained unable to talk to people.

After 5th grade, my parents had decided to homeschool me - and probably for good reason. If I had been left to my own devices in a regular middle school setting, I’d probably not be typing this because I’d be sitting in a state penitentiary. For real. Growing up, I was often called a sociopath or psychopath because of my eccentric behaviors. This happened frequently enough that I was left wondering sometimes if I was a psychopath. And my social deviance was great enough that I might have been led into other forms of deviance. In reality I was far from a sociopath. In fact, I had a heart for animals and felt compassion for the outcasts of society, because I identified as being one of them. The fate of me being homeschooled, however, had one extremely adverse side effect: it amplified my tendencies to socially isolate. 

As a homeschooler, once I began operating outside the glass wall, I was stricken down by chronic anxiety. I became extremely fearful, to the point of paranoia, of any social interaction. I had no friends. I went days without seeing, texting, or calling anyone except for my parents, out of fear of leaving the house and being seen. Upon having a small interaction, perhaps with a barista (note: my obsessive love for coffee would sometimes get me out of the house after I turned 16), I would contemplate the two sentences I said for many hours. I would visualize and internalize the expression on the person’s face. This case of anxiety was crippling, and unfortunately I sought no help.

In no small part because of my extreme social anxiety, I experienced a multi-years-long bout of depression. I’m far from claiming that I was truly depressed, on a clinical level. But I regularly contemplated the action of suicide, and I developed the practice of journaling down my thoughts as a prayer, and inside those (eventually hundreds of) pages contain many references to suicide. I don’t believe that I was ever truly close to following through with it, but I was devastatingly miserable. I was paralyzed by this overwhelming thought that, given my inability to function in this world, I would never discover my own potential. It was an unbearable concept for me, as I cared deeply about a number of societal issues (more on that later) and wanted to make an impact on them. The idea of not seeing who I was capable of becoming kept me from experiencing a singular fleeting moment of happiness for probably 4.5 years - all of high school and then some.

I say all of this to say: I don’t have autism anymore.

And I don’t know how to make sense of what the heck happened to me.

Well, maybe I worded it that way for a lil shock value. So, let me explain my predicament further, which will require the introduction of an element which was deeply interlaced with my experience on the spectrum: food. My diet and my presentation of autism were interlaced, fated to dance with one another.

The second dot to connect: the health challenge.

When I was eight-years-old, my family participated in what was called a health challenge. The health challenge required us to make changes to our diet and lifestyle for six weeks. Although my parents had been inspired to take on the challenge for their own health goals, it created a series of domino effects that ended up transforming me. In the subsequent years, I have implemented a variety of diet and lifestyle related changes that left me feeling radically different than I had felt on a standard American diet. Although, as a culture, we tend to think of food as something that affects our physical health, I found that diet, most fundamentally, interacted with my mental health. All of those autistic behaviors and mental health related symptoms from an early age had led me to visits with psychologists and a neurologist. And yet, more than anything I learned in those visits, food had the greatest impact on how I felt and behaved. The health challenge inspired me to make dietary changes that would end up setting me on an undeniably different trajectory than my life would have gone without the event.

The health challenge had a somewhat standard set of rules as far as diets go: cut out the sugar, avoid boxed and canned foods when possible, exercise between 30 minutes to an hour per day, get at least seven hours of sleep, to name a few. Until middle school, my diet was composed of exactly what the challenge required me to avoid. I injected myself with a high-sugar breakfast, moved on to a lunch powered by processed cafeteria lunchroom food, and then ended the day with fast food or an otherwise carb-loaded dinner. The health challenge constituted a six-week interruption in my diet, but in spite of the brevity, I was able to take note of a change. Being just 8 years old, I could not express exactly what that change was, but it prompted me to start thinking. 

Perhaps the experiences that have the greatest impact on us happen at a young age, at a time when we can’t express what’s happening, but a seed is planted that manifests an abundance of something later. For me the seed was this: it was as though the food I ate influenced the way my brain told me to express myself - in social situations, and \*especially notable\* in regard to my anger management issues.

I can’t help but feel hopeful that my subjective anecdotes may be corroborated by something in the scientific literature. At least, I would love to see if there’s enough one-off cases congruent to mine which could be compiled into a body of literature suggesting that neurodivergent symptoms can be mitigated by lifestyle interventions. More fundamentally, I would love to see if such evidence might point to fundamental truths about the autism spectrum. I have seen the occasional report suggest that autism might be an energy deficiency problem rooted in mitochondrial dysfunction, or that autism is an insulin resistance problem, or that it’s a gut-brain axis issue. I am supposing that a fundamental substrate, one that is potentially influenced by lifestyle intervention, underlies each of these potential findings.

Cleaning up my diet was, to be sure, one among a number of catalysts that allowed for progress in my life. Another influential factor was that I was sent to a small Christian college, where I found myself immersed in a socially-driven environment. I was unable to escape people there, and it forced that long dormant imitation gene (so to speak) to actualize. Finally, after all those years, I painfully began to learn the social script.

So, fast forward to the present moment. I do not manifest a single mental health issue, I transferred to a T20 school, and I fell in love. As such, I cannot help but feel a deep obligation to now share my experiences with others. I am not sure how that undertaking may unfold, but I suspect there are others who do not yet recognize they have an acute sensitivity to what they eat and may be impacted by a story like mine.
